<h4>Core Tools</h4>
<p>The trifecta of configuration and maintainence tools.  Bootstrap, Setup, and Update.</p>

<p>Bootstrap is responsible for installing the prerequisites required for pretty much everything else to work.  It is one of the only tools written in Powershell because it is most often run on a new workstation which wont yet have Python installed.</p>

<p>Setup is a tool that can be manually run to perform most of the work required when setting up a new workstation.  The tool itself requires Bootstrap to be run first, but the <a href="/tools/setup_workstation">Setup Workstation</a> binary does this automatically.</p>

<p>Update is a tool that runs on all supported workstations as a check in Remote Management.  It allows for easy automatic installation and updating of packages.</p>

<p>You can find detailed information on each tool here:</p>

<h4>Portal</h4>
<p>The website that you're currently reading.  It houses documentation and various tools.</p>
<p>Describing how the Portal is built is beyond the scope of this documentation, but you can find the source code on <a href="/documentation/gitlab">GitLab</a> if you are interested.</p>

<h4>Remote Management Scripts</h4>
<p>Checks and tasks that run on the Remote Management platform.</p>
<p>Checks are divided into these categories:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Alert</b> - Monitor various bits of a workstation and fail should they detect an issue.</li>
    <li><b>Information</b> - Gather information about a workstation and display it.  These do not fail during normal operation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tools are exactly the same as Checks, but run as Background Tasks instead.  This allows them to have a maximum 24 hour runtime, rather than the 150 second maximum for checks.</p>
