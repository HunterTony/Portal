<h1>Core Tools - PCSetup</h1>
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>PCSetup is a tool that can be manually run to perform most of the work required when setting up a new workstation.  The tool itself requires PCBootstrap to be run first, but a standalone binary PCSetup-AutoRun is downloadable from the Portal which runs PCBootstrap and then PCSetup automatically.</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Details</h4>

<p>PCSetup is written in Python.  It is an "old" system, so the source is not available on <a href="/documentation/gitlab">GitLab</a>.</p>

<hr/>

<h4>Debugging</h4>
<p>PCSetup rarely fails, and is safe to interrupt and later resume at any point during execution.  Generally the only case where you will see a failure is when the workstation's internet connection is slow or unstable.</p>
