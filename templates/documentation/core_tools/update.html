<h4>Overview</h4>
<h3 style="color: red">Changing Soon - Checkback for changes later</h3>
<p>Update is a tool that runs on all supported workstations as a check in remote management.  It allows for easy automatic installation and updating of packages.</p>

<hr/>

<h4>Details</h4>
<p>Update is written in Python.  It is an "old" system, so the source is not available on <a href="/documentation/gitlab">GitLab</a>.</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Debugging</h4>
<p>Update rarely fails, and is safe to interrupt and later resume at any point during execution.  Generally the only case where you will see a failure is when the workstation's internet connection is slow or unstable.</p>
<p>You may also see a message referencing a lock file "C:\Cilix\Update\lock".  If the check fails more than one with this message then delete the lock file.</p>
