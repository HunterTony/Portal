<h4>Overview</h4>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> is a hosted Git platform that houses source code for all modern systems.  By "modern" I mean any projects written or updated in the end of 2015 and the beginning of 2016.</p>

<hr/>

<h4>Details</h4>
<p>Each project is owned by the "cilix" group.  The group is owned by a shared user "cilix_support", the password for which can be found in PasswordSafe.</p>
<p>Anyone who wishes to access GitLab should create an account of their own and invite it to the group using the cilix_support account.</p>

<br/>

<p>If you need to make a change to any of the projects, you will need to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Pull the project</li>
    <li>Make your changes to the source files</li>
    <li>Commit your changes</li>
    <li>Push your commits</li>
</ul>
<p>Detailed information on these steps can be found on the <a target="_blank" href="https://git-scm.com/">Git Website</a></p>
